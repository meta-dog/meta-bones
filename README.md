# Reporting Issues

Before creating an issue, please verify the following:

## My Referral could not be added

- Please make sure that you are capable of referring this game. In order to do so, you must use the Oculus App to create the referral link. Even if you own the game, some will not allow you to create the referrals.
- In case of doubt, try to navigate to the URL: https://www.oculus.com/appreferrals/{YOUR_USERNAME}/{APP_ID} while logged in (some links may appear valid within an incognito or logged out tab but then turn out to be invalid once logged in)
- If your Referral was blacklisted and you have created a valid link, you can open an issue so I can remove it from the blacklist
